						<h3>Genesis 11:4</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may
						each unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon
						the face of the whole earth.</p>
						<aside class="notes">The 2nd city in the bible is Babel which became Babylon, right? so far all the cities in the bible were wicked cities and were started by wicked people</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Evangalisim p. 28</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">The Lord will not suddenly cast off all transgressors or destroy entire nations; but He will punish cities and places where men have given themselves up to the possession of Satanic agencies. Strictly will the cities of the nations be dealt with, and yet they will not be visited in the extreme of God's indignation, because some souls will yet break away from the delusions of the enemy, and will repent and be converted, while the mass will be treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath.

						<h3>Genesis 19:24,25</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from
						the LORD out of heaven;</p>
  						<p style="text-align: justify;">25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants
						of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</p>
						<aside class="notes">Why was Sodom distroyed?</aside>

						<h3>Selected Messages Book 2 p.417</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">
							  I have wondered that the inhabitants of the earth were not destroyed, like the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. I have seen reason enough for the present state of degeneracy and mortality in the world. Blind passion controls reason, and every high consideration with many is sacrificed to lust.

						<h3>Evangelism p. 79</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">When iniquity abounds in a nation, there is always to be heard some voice giving warning and instruction, as the voice of Lot was heard in Sodom. Yet Lot could have preserved his family from many evils, had he not made his home in this wicked, polluted city. All that Lot and his family did in Sodom could have been done by them, even if they had lived in a place some distance away from the city. Enoch walked with God, and yet he did not live in the midst of any city, polluted with every kind of violence and wickedness, as did Lot in Sodom.</p>
						<aside class="notes">Look at that! the same (or better) influence can be had on the city <ins>while living outside of it</ins></aside>

						<h3>Genesis 13:9-12</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">10Â And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Genesis 13:9-12</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.</p>
						<aside class="notes">Lot chose the city and the fertile land contrast that with Abram (Abraham) who chose the lesser land away from the cities</aside>

						<h3>Counsels on diets and food chap. 4</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;"> In order to have good health, we must have good blood; for the blood is the current of life. It repairs waste, and nourishes the body. When supplied with the proper food elements and when cleansed and vitalized by contact with pure air, it carries life and vigor to every part of the system. The more perfect the circulation, the better will this work be accomplished.</p>
						<aside class="notes"><ins>perfect circulation = perfect health</ins> ; pure air is so important to the blood as it is the medium with which gaseous impurities are eliminated,  and pure oxygen is absorbed; if the air is poluted with toxins, they can damage the tissues in you lungs</aside>

						<h3>The Adventist Home p.142</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">To live in the country would be very beneficial to them; an active, out-of-door life would develop health of both mind and body. They should have a garden to cultivate, where they might find both amusement and useful employment. The training of plants and flowers tends to the improvement of taste and judgment, while an acquaintance with God's useful and beautiful creations has a refining and ennobling influence upon the mind, referring it to the Maker and Master of all.

						<p style="text-align: justify;">
							so far as possible, all who are seeking to recover health should place themselves amid country surroundings where they can have the benefit of outdoor life. Nature is God's physician. The pure air, the glad sunshine, the flowers and trees, the orchards and vineyards, and outdoor exercise amid these surroundings, are health-giving, life-giving.

						 I urge our people to make it their lifework to seek for spirituality. Christ is at the door. This is why I say to our people, Do not consider it a privation when you are called to leave the cities and move out into the country places. Here there await rich blessings for those who will grasp them. By beholding the scenes of nature, the works of the Creator, by studying God's handiwork, imperceptibly you will be changed into the same image
